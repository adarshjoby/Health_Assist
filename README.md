# Health_Assist

## Introduction
Health Assist aims to a digital companianon towards leading an healthier life. It takes health information of the user, and on the basis of historical data and trends, aims to give an insight into the probability in getting different diseases. This probabiltiy displayed visually will motivate the user to take on better life choices, to lead a more healthier and longer life. The information displayed is based on previous cases and is NOT to replace medical professionals' advice. Always check with your medical professional incase of any emergencies. 

## Description
### Tech Stack Used
Jupyter Notebook with Python 

### Algorithim 
We find out probabilty on contracting a disease on each condition with the help of Historical Medical Data. The total probability can be found with the help of conditional probabilty and Total probabilty theorem. With the help of matplot, graphs can be created based on the output for a better understanding of effects of unhealthy choices that a user takes.
